React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs).
Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create dynamic and interactive UIs efficiently.

It has two modules - 
In the React library, ReactDOM and React Native are two separate modules that help render React components in different environments.

ReactDOM:
ReactDOM is a package/module that provides DOM-specific methods that React uses to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model). 
It's used when you're building web applications with React.

React Native:
React Native is a separate but related framework built on top of React. It allows you to build mobile applications using React syntax.
React Native uses native components instead of web components to build mobile user interfaces. It allows you to create mobile apps 
that run on iOS and Android devices, using JavaScript and React.

============================== What is npx and npm =========================================

npm (Node Package Manager):
npm is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js. It comes bundled with Node.js installation. It's used to install, manage, and 
share reusable code packages/modules or libraries for JavaScript and Node.js projects.
Developers use npm to install packages from the npm registry, which is a repository for open-source JavaScript packages. 
It also allows you to manage project dependencies by specifying them in a package.json file.

npx (Node Package Runner):
npx is a tool that comes with npm version 5.2.0 & above. It is used to execute Node.js packages without having to install them globally or locally.
It allows you to run packages as if they were installed globally without actually installing them. This is particularly useful for running packages
that you don't want to install permanently or that you want to try out without polluting your project's dependencies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Differences:-

npm primarily manages packages. It installs packages locally in your project or globally on your system. You use it to install and manage 
dependencies for your projects.
With npm, you install packages like below:

npm install package-name        // This command installs a package in your project, adding it to your package.json file.

-------------------------------------------

npx is a tool for running packages. It comes bundled with npm, and it allows you to execute commands from npm packages without installing them 
permanently. It's handy for running one-off commands or executables.

With npx, you run packages without installing them:

npx package-name                // This command runs a package without the need for a prior installation. 

It fetches the latest version, executes the command, and then discards it.

================================================ First React App =====================================================================

In React JS we'll use npx only..
Open Terminal - type npx create-react-app 01basicreactapp       //01basicreactapp is just folder Name. you can give anyname

****here we're using create-react-app method to create react app..***

it will take some time. after installation you can run using this command - cd 01basicreactapp
means change directory to 01basicreactapp - 

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files    
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back! 

--------------------------------------

Once you'll run - npm start or npm run start command it will generate two link through which you can open your project

Exp - 
Compiled successfully!

You can now view 01basicreactapp in the browser. 

  Local:            http://localhost:3000        
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.49:3000 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inside 01basicreactapp - below dir should be present and if package.json is present then we can run all scripts..
command to check this dir -> cd 01basicreactapp dir
Directory: C:\Users\77079\OneDrive\Documents\React-JS\01basicreactapp

Goto Package.json ---
we can see name our project and version of react.
--dependencies -
some testing libraries and --
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",   // using this we can execute command
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"      // performance measurement

-- scripts --
start , build , test , eject(means we can eject react lib from any project saying like, this amount of work was for react and can work on other lib)

-- eslintConfig --
sometimes we see a yellow dot on any piece of code for improvement. means it will not be an error but we can make that better using suggestion

--browserlist --
can see which browser support for development

after running npm run build command one build folder will be create..

---------------------------------- React Project Using Vite --------------------------------------
Doc Link - https://vitejs.dev/guide/

Now we're going to create react app using vite lib...

open terminal - in React-JS folder - type npm create vite@latest
PS C:\Users\77079\OneDrive\Documents\React-JS> npm create vite@latest
Need to install the following packages:
create-vite@5.1.0
Ok to proceed? (y) y
√ Project name: ... 01vitereactapp
√ Select a framework: » React
√ Select a variant: » JavaScript

Scaffolding project in C:\Users\77079\OneDrive\Documents\React-JS\01vitereactapp...

Done. Now run:

  cd 01vitereactapp     // for going this directory to execute command
  npm install           // this will create required Packages (node_modules folder)
  npm run dev           // for executing project..

after executing npm run dev project url will be create..
VITE v5.0.11  ready in 942 ms
