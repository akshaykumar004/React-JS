--------------------Comparison with create react app and vite react app -------------------

First deleting some files in both project to make the project easy to understand.. mostly it will be CSS and logo ..

delete their dependencies in app.jsx/js and main.jsx/js

---------------================= Analysis of Create-React-App  =========================================--------

Ignore build folder and node_module folder. bcz build folder is for build purpose during devlopment of app.
and node_module folder contains all the dependencies which are present in package.json of app.
package-lock-json folder - all the stable version of dependencies will be locked in this folder means this will be run on these versions only.

manifest.json - used for mobile user. used to see metatags of website 
robots.txt  - it is for search engine..
index.html - this is responsible for page loading.

<noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript> 
this tag will give a msg like you've to enable JS to run the app in browser.

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>        // StrictMode is for safe purpose in devlopment env. you can run code without this also.
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

ReactDOM will create a virtual DOM and store in root variable. createRoot is a component or element . 
root will render app.js using react-scripts. it is adding all the scripts and html to JS and making html run with JS.

Render() -  in React is a crucial method that defines what should be displayed by a component. It returns a description of 
the UI elements to be rendered, and React takes care of updating the actual DOM based on the changes in the virtual DOM.


---------------================= Analysis of Vite-React-App  =========================================--------

in Vite project.json no react-scripts are there so how index.html will add into our js ?
if you notice in vite-react app index.html file is outside of folder but in create-react-app it is under public folder.

so goto index.html - it is adding directly <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script> in this file.
so we dont need to add script to run html with js. it is happening in index.html itself.

if you notice basicreactapp index.js and vitereactapp main.jsx is same just small diffrence is in basicreactapp first storing
into a variable and then applying render and in vite directly calling render using (.)
naming convention is diffrent but it is same only. you can choose both JS or JSX 

doubt - app.jsx is rending in main.jsx so can we rend any other file in app.jsx or main.jsx
make one file jsx file  under src folder

Note - Always give file name extension jsx otherwise you'll get error 
** Failed to parse source for import 
analysis because the content contains invalid JS syntax. If you are using JSX, make sure to name the file with the .jsx or .tsx extension.

also function name should be start from capital letter otherwise you'll get below error

** Warning: The tag <render> is unrecognized in this browser. If you meant to render a React component, start its name with an uppercase letter.

If you're rending any component then you can return only one component at a time
but if you want to return multiple then you've to use any tag under which you can pass multiple element like 
<div> ....</div> so avoid this multiple times 

we can write directly <> </> empty tag. it is called fragment is React.

////////////////////////////////-------------------------------

In Create-React-App file name extension is not mandatory for JSX. but function name should be start by capital letter.

but for better practice - if html is returning then give file name by .jsx and if not the .js is fine. --- in Create-React-App

index.js or main.jsx is just a default file name.. you can give any file name..
