================================= Currency Converter ============================

---------------------------------- Step -1 --------- 
Add tailwind CSS
create one folder under src folder called hooks and inside that create one file called useCurrency.js (since it is not returning both 
javaScript and html so extension will be only .js not .jsx)

Inside useCurrency.js - create custom hooks which wil fetch api fo Currency Converter.
fetch(`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fawazahmed0/currency-api@1/latest/currencies/${currency}.json`)
here instead of ${currency}, you can give any currency name like usd or inr.. it is just variable name so that during fetching api you can give 
any currency name according to your requirement...
exp - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fawazahmed0/currency-api@1/latest/currencies/inr.json  --- here inr is given instead of ${currency}...

// since this json data is in string format so we've to change into json..
after using fetch we can do chaining.... exp - .then()
