=============== Password Generator Notes =========================

Step 1 - Create UI ------

create one div under which all code will be return. 
1- one <h1> tag for heading - Password Generator
2- create second <div> which will have input type and one button. input type will show Password and button will copy Password
into clipboard
3- create 3rd <div> which is having range of password and two checkbox having label with name of Number and Character.
so that after selecting them password will update including them(Number and Character)

Now UI is done..........

Step -2 - behind the scene----

define 4 useState through which we will work on functionality of Password.
length , Number , Character and Password

length - default is 6 and max is 10...
Number - After selecting this checkbox password will update including Number
Character - After selecting this checkbox password will update including Character
password - will store password and show through this..

Step - 3-------------- For process optimization

define useCallBack() hook which will Generate password and store into setpassword
//useCallback(fn , []) hook   // useCallBack accept one fun() and dependencies(array) on which you want to callback

since we want to update password after every click on Number checkbox or Character checkbox or length so we'll use useCallBack so that
using this we can update after every actiion .. this is used for optimization the process

Step - 4-------- For Generating Password

//useEffect(fn , []) hook   // useEffect also accept one fun() and dependencies...

 this is for functionality of Generating password. it has one method passwordGenerator under which logic of Generating
 password is written. and that is written under useCallBack() hook so that perfomance will be optimized..


Step - 5 ---------------- For copy password into clipboard

 Now define -----------------------
 //useRef hook   -- used to take reference of any element
  const passwordRef = useRef(null)

since the copy button having one onClick method copyPasswordToClipboard and inside this using useRef() hook we
will copy password into clipboard
