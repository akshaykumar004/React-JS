Step-1 -------

First create tailwind using tailwind site

under src folder create a file called theme.js .. inside this we'll create context using React.createContext method

inside this context we'll some default value so that during accessing the app it will not crash or anything will not fail

so we'll pass on object and inside this one default lightMode so that app dont crash and two predefined method - darkTheme and lightTheme with data.

Step-2 -------------------

In App.jsx --- wrap all content under ThemeProvider
now ThemeProvider shaould have some values so that it can implement things so we'll pass all declared 
method - themeMode , lightTheme , darkTheme

now lightTheme and darkTheme is a method but it is not declared so declare it with same name so that it will take
automatically all functionality automatically..

///-------- How the theme will change -------------

for this we have to write JS code -- we're using useEffect() call back function and selecting the class of themeMode
and performing action based on defined action in themeMode

Step-3 ------------

create one folder called components under src and create two jsx file themeBtn and Card 

copy and paste all data from UI.md for UI.....

inside themeBtn import useTheme which we created in theme.js file... and using this call all method themeMode, lightTheme, darkTheme

and on check box for toggle theme.. write some functionality..


Note -- add this in tailwind.config.js -- darkMode: "class", then only darkTheme will work after changing to dark...
